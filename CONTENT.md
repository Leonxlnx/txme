## 5. PROCESS

**Headline:**
How we work.

**Subline:**
Four phases. Zero bullshit.

### Phase 1: Discover
We listen. Deep research into your brand, audience, and goals. We ask the right questions before writing a single line of code.

### Phase 2: Concept
Ideas take shape. We combine strategy with creative direction to define the experience — mood, motion, interaction.

### Phase 3: Craft
Where the magic happens. Design and development run in parallel. We prototype fast, iterate faster, and obsess over every detail.

### Phase 4: Launch & Beyond
We ship it, measure it, and optimize it. Our work doesn't end at launch — we stay involved to make sure the experience keeps performing.

## 6. PHILOSOPHY / MANIFESTO

**Headline:**
We believe the web deserves better.

**Body:**
Too many websites look the same. We're here to change that. The internet should be a canvas — not a template. Every brand has a story worth experiencing, and we exist to make that experience as powerful as the story itself.

We don't chase trends. We start them.
